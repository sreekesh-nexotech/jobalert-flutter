Prompt 5
----------
You are a Flutter caching architect. Audit this codebase for Hive cache implementation correctness, covering all cache scenarios, eviction, concurrency, and HTTP optimization.

### CRITICAL VIOLATIONS
1. No 3-layer cache (L1 Memory → L2 Hive → L3 Network) — data fetched directly from API on every call
2. Cache key does not incorporate HTTP method, sorted query params, request body hash, and auth token hash (SHA256)
3. No request deduplication pool — same endpoint called twice simultaneously makes two network calls
4. Hive write errors block the UI thread instead of failing silently and continuing
5. No response validation pipeline before caching — invalid/partial responses written to cache
6. Cache corruption not recovered — HiveError/FormatException crashes the app instead of falling back to API

### HIGH PRIORITY
7. Cold start shows no skeleton loader while API call is in-flight
8. Warm start (cache < 12h old) does not show cached data immediately — waits for API response
9. No background refresh with non-intrusive "updating..." indicator on warm start
10. Stale cache (> 24h old) shown without amber warning banner or "Tap to refresh" affordance
11. Offline mode: no persistent offline indicator shown in app bar when network is unavailable
12. Offline mode: app retries API continuously instead of listening to ConnectivityPlus stream and retrying once on reconnect
13. If-Modified-Since header not sent on API calls when Last-Modified metadata exists in cache
14. HTTP 304 Not Modified response not handled — full re-parse attempted instead of returning cached data
15. HTTP 412 Precondition Failed not handled — cache not deleted and request not retried without If-Modified-Since
16. Exponential backoff retry strategy missing or incorrect (must be: 4 attempts, delays +2s/+4s/+8s, max total 15s, 4xx errors must NOT be retried)
17. HiveProvider is not a singleton with a lock — multiple Hive box instances can be opened concurrently across isolates

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
18. Hive size monitor not running every 5 minutes to check against 200MB limit
19. Eviction does not delete oldest 20% of LRU entries when Hive exceeds 90% capacity (180MB)
20. Memory cache does not evict LRU entry on every write when entries > 500 or size > 50MB
21. CacheEntry model missing per-entry metadata: accessCount, lastAccessed, size (bytes)
22. Cache corruption recovery missing: same cache key corrupted 3+ times in 1 hour must be blacklisted (not cached) for 5 minutes
23. 10 consecutive Hive write failures do not trigger Hive disable with a user-visible warning
24. Paginated responses not cached with per-page independent cache keys
25. Last-Modified value incorrectly replaced on 304 response (must NOT be updated on 304, only on 200)
26. CacheConfig constants not centralised — timeout (10s), valid threshold (12h), stale threshold (24h), max retries (4), retry base delay (2s), memory limits (50MB/500 entries), Hive limit (200MB) are hardcoded across files

## SCENARIO VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Run through each scenario manually or via integration test:

**Scenario 1 — Cold Start (no cache, network available)**
- [ ] Memory miss → Hive miss → skeleton loader shown
- [ ] API call made with 10s timeout
- [ ] On success: UI updates, Memory written sync, Hive written async (non-blocking)
- [ ] On timeout: error shown, retry available
- [ ] On parse failure: error logged, not cached, error shown
- [ ] On Hive write failure: logged silently, app continues

**Scenario 2 — Warm Start (cache < 12h, network available)**
- [ ] Hive hit → data loaded to Memory → cached UI shown within ~50ms
- [ ] Background API call made with If-Modified-Since header
- [ ] 304: "updating..." hidden, cache timestamp updated, Last-Modified NOT changed
- [ ] 200: data animated in, Memory + Hive updated, Last-Modified replaced
- [ ] API failure: cached data kept, indicator hidden, error logged

**Scenario 3 — Warm Start (no network)**
- [ ] Hive hit → data shown immediately
- [ ] Persistent offline indicator shown in app bar
- [ ] No continuous retry — listens to ConnectivityPlus stream
- [ ] Auto-retries once when connectivity restored
- [ ] Hive corrupted + offline: error screen with retry button shown

**Scenario 4 — Navigation Between Screens**
- [ ] Memory hit returns in 1–5ms with no API call
- [ ] Memory evicted: falls through to Hive (Scenario 2 flow)
- [ ] Both miss: falls through to API (Scenario 1 flow)

**Scenario 5 — Stale Cache (> 24h)**
- [ ] Stale data shown with amber banner: "Data from X ago • Tap to refresh"
- [ ] Background API call with exponential backoff (4 attempts max)
- [ ] 4xx errors: retry stopped, warning removed, error logged
- [ ] 5xx errors: retry strategy applied
- [ ] All retries exhausted: "Unable to update" message, stale data kept
- [ ] Tap banner / pull-to-refresh: retry counter reset, immediate retry

**Scenario 6 — Conditional Requests (HTTP 304)**
- [ ] If-Modified-Since header added when metadata exists
- [ ] 304: cached data returned, access timestamp updated, Last-Modified unchanged
- [ ] 200: new data parsed, Last-Modified replaced with response header value
- [ ] 412: cache entry deleted, request retried without If-Modified-Since

**Scenario 7 — Concurrent Requests (Race Condition)**
- [ ] Two simultaneous calls to same endpoint make only ONE network request
- [ ] Both callers receive the same Future result
- [ ] RequestPool entry removed on completion or error

**Scenario 8 — Cache Eviction**
- [ ] Hive monitor runs every 5 minutes
- [ ] At >180MB: oldest 20% of entries deleted by LRU, Hive compacted
- [ ] Memory cache: LRU entry evicted on each write when >500 entries or >50MB

**Scenario 9 — Cache Corruption Recovery**
- [ ] HiveError/FormatException caught on read
- [ ] Corrupted entry deleted, key marked as corrupted for 5 minutes
- [ ] Falls back to API call
- [ ] Same key corrupted 3+ times in 1 hour: result not cached
- [ ] Hive write error: caught, logged, does not block UI
- [ ] 10 consecutive write failures: Hive disabled, warning shown to user

**Scenario 10 — Partial/Invalid Response**
- [ ] Validation pipeline runs: HTTP status → Content-Type → JSON parse → schema → required fields → data types
- [ ] Any failure: cache not updated, previous cached data returned if available
- [ ] Error message shown, full response logged for debugging
- [ ] Manual retry allowed

## IMPLEMENTATION CLASS CHECKS

Verify these classes exist and are correctly implemented:

**CacheConfig**
- [ ] `memoryCacheMaxSize = 50MB`
- [ ] `memoryCacheMaxEntries = 500`
- [ ] `hiveCacheMaxSize = 200MB`
- [ ] `staleCacheThreshold = 24h`
- [ ] `validCacheThreshold = 12h`
- [ ] `apiTimeout = 10s`
- [ ] `maxRetryAttempts = 4`
- [ ] `retryBaseDelay = 2s`

**CacheEntry (@HiveType)**
- [ ] `key`, `data`, `lastModified`, `cachedAt`, `lastAccessed`, `accessCount`, `size` fields present
- [ ] All fields annotated with `@HiveField`
- [ ] `isStale` getter: `now - cachedAt > 24h`
- [ ] `isValid` getter: `now - cachedAt < 12h`

**RetryPolicy**
- [ ] Exponential delay: `pow(2, attempt-1) * 2` seconds
- [ ] 4xx errors re-thrown immediately (no retry)
- [ ] Max 4 attempts before throwing

**HiveProvider**
- [ ] Singleton `_box` with `Lock` from `synchronized` package
- [ ] All Hive operations go through `HiveProvider.getBox()`
- [ ] No direct `Hive.openBox()` calls outside HiveProvider

**RequestPool**
- [ ] `Map<String, Completer>` tracks in-flight requests by cache key
- [ ] Returns existing Future if request in-flight
- [ ] Removes entry from pool on success and error

Prompt 6
----------
You are a Flutter architecture auditor. Audit this codebase for compliance with its 4-layer architecture (Domain → Infrastructure → Application → Presentation), Riverpod state purity, Hive model integrity, and responsive UI rules.

### CRITICAL VIOLATIONS

**Hive Model Integrity**
1. Two or more `@HiveType` classes share the same `typeId` — causes silent data corruption across all devices
2. A `@HiveField` index was changed after data was already saved to device — existing data will be read incorrectly (fields mismatched)
3. A `@HiveType` model is missing a `TypeAdapter` registration before any box is opened

**Layer Boundary Violations**
4. Presentation layer (screens/widgets) accesses Infrastructure directly — calls `AuthApi`, `Hive`, or `Dio` without going through a provider
5. Application layer (StateNotifier/Provider) imports from `infrastructure/` — business logic must call the domain contract, not the implementation
6. Domain layer imports from `infrastructure/` or `application/` — domain must have zero upward dependencies
7. `ref.read()` used inside `build()` for reactive state — `ref.read()` does not subscribe, so the widget will not rebuild when state changes

**Domain Layer Purity**
8. A domain entity class contains a method that fetches data, calls an API, reads Hive, or contains UI logic
9. An abstract domain repository contains implementation code inside method bodies (curly braces with logic) instead of being a pure contract

**Infrastructure Layer Purity**
10. A `remote/` API class (e.g. `AuthApi`) contains caching decisions, business logic, or direct Hive calls — it must only make the HTTP call and convert the JSON response to a domain entity
11. Hive reads or writes exist outside of `infrastructure/local/` — any Hive access in `application/`, `presentation/`, or `domain/` is a boundary violation

### HIGH PRIORITY

**Riverpod / State**
12. A `StateNotifier` controller holds a reference to the infrastructure implementation (`AuthRepositoryImpl`) instead of the domain contract (`AuthRepository`) — breaks dependency inversion
13. A `State` class has mutable (`non-final`) fields — state must be immutable; all updates must go through `copyWith()`
14. `StateNotifier` updates state by mutating fields directly instead of using `copyWith()` to produce a new state object
15. `StatefulWidget` is used to manage actual data state (user profile, cart items, API results) instead of Riverpod — `StatefulWidget` is for purely visual/local state only (e.g. password show/hide, dropdown open/close)

**Infrastructure Repository**
16. An infrastructure repository class does not declare `implements <DomainRepository>` — the domain contract is not being fulfilled
17. An infrastructure repository method returns data without first checking the local Hive cache — skips the cache-check-then-API pattern

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

18. Feature folder does not follow the required 4-layer structure: `features/<name>/domain/`, `features/<name>/infrastructure/`, `features/<name>/application/`, `features/<name>/presentation/`
19. Hardcoded pixel values (`SizedBox(width: 24)`, `padding: EdgeInsets.all(16)`) used instead of ScreenUtil equivalents (`24.w`, `16.r`)
20. A domain entity has fields that are not `final` — entities must be immutable value objects
21. `ref.watch()` and `ref.read()` usage reversed: `ref.watch()` in a callback/onPressed, or `ref.read()` used where the widget must react to changes
22. A `ConsumerWidget` is used where no Riverpod provider is read — should be a `StatelessWidget`

## ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### Domain Layer (`features/<name>/domain/`)
- [ ] All entity classes contain only `final` fields — no methods that fetch, mutate, or display
- [ ] All domain repository files are `abstract class` with no implementation inside method bodies
- [ ] Domain layer imports nothing from `infrastructure/`, `application/`, or `presentation/`
- [ ] No Hive, Dio, SharedPreferences, or Flutter imports anywhere in `domain/`

### Infrastructure Layer (`features/<name>/infrastructure/`)
- [ ] Every `remote/` class (API) only makes HTTP calls and converts JSON → domain entity. No caching, no business logic
- [ ] Every `local/` class is the ONLY file in the project that reads from or writes to Hive for its feature
- [ ] Every infrastructure repository class declares `implements <DomainRepository>`
- [ ] Every infrastructure repository method checks local cache before making a network call
- [ ] No `Hive` import exists outside of `infrastructure/local/` files

### Hive Model Integrity
- [ ] Every `@HiveType` class has a unique `typeId` — run a search across all files to confirm no duplicates
- [ ] No `@HiveField` index has been changed from its original value on a model that has already shipped to users
- [ ] Every `TypeAdapter` is registered in `main.dart` or an initializer before any `Hive.openBox()` call
- [ ] `@HiveField` indices are contiguous starting from 0 — no gaps (gaps suggest a field was deleted; document this)

### Application Layer (`features/<name>/application/`)
- [ ] Every `StateNotifier` constructor accepts the domain repository interface (abstract class), not the implementation
- [ ] All `State` classes have only `final` fields and a `copyWith()` method
- [ ] All state mutations inside `StateNotifier` use `copyWith()` — no direct field assignments
- [ ] No `import` from `infrastructure/` in any application-layer file
- [ ] `FutureProvider` is used only for read operations — mutations use `StateNotifierProvider`
- [ ] No `BuildContext`, `Navigator`, `SnackBar`, or `Dialog` in any provider or notifier

### Presentation Layer (`features/<name>/presentation/`)
- [ ] No `import` from `infrastructure/` — no direct Hive, Dio, or API class access
- [ ] No business logic in `build()` methods — data transformation belongs in the application or infrastructure layer
- [ ] `ref.watch()` used only inside `build()` — never in `onPressed`, `initState`, or async callbacks
- [ ] `ref.read()` used only in callbacks (`onPressed`, `onChange`) — never in `build()` for reactive state
- [ ] Widget type used correctly per decision tree:
  - `ConsumerWidget` → widget reads from at least one Riverpod provider
  - `StatefulWidget` → widget manages purely visual/local state (show/hide, open/close)
  - `StatelessWidget` → widget only receives data as constructor parameters and renders it
- [ ] No hardcoded pixel values — all sizes use ScreenUtil (`sp`, `w`, `h`, `r`)

### Feature Folder Structure
For each feature, verify this structure exists:
```
features/<feature_name>/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/         ← plain Dart classes, final fields only
│   └── repositories/     ← abstract contracts, no implementation
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── data_sources/
│   │   ├── remote/       ← HTTP only, Dio, JSON → entity
│   │   └── local/        ← Hive only, no business logic
│   └── repositories/     ← implements domain contract
├── application/
│   ├── states/           ← immutable state classes with copyWith()
│   ├── providers/        ← Riverpod provider registrations
│   └── usecases/         ← (optional) complex multi-step operations
└── presentation/
    ├── screens/          ← full pages, ConsumerWidget
    └── components/       ← reusable UI pieces for this feature
```

## ARCHITECTURE HEALTH REPORT

| Layer | Files Audited | Critical | High | Medium | Status |
|-------|---------------|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Domain | ... | ... | ... | ... | PASS / FAIL |
| Infrastructure | ... | ... | ... | ... | PASS / FAIL |
| Application | ... | ... | ... | ... | PASS / FAIL |

| Cross-layer boundaries | ... | ... | ... | ... | PASS / FAIL |
| Hive model integrity | ... | ... | ... | ... | PASS / FAIL |

## ARCHITECTURE SCORE
Rate 1-10 based on:
- Layer boundary discipline (no shortcuts between layers)
- Domain purity (entities and contracts have no implementation leaks)
- Infrastructure isolation (Hive and Dio confined correctly)
- Riverpod correctness (watch/read usage, state immutability)
- Folder structure compliance per feature
